        <p class="main__para1">Redirect. Realign. Reconnect. Those words are the bells that now ring loudly in our ears since March 2020. Covid-19 pushed the pause button on the remote. The world so large yet so small for once, was on the same channel airing the same story. The world that we knew was no more and so change came forth with a force rivaling the speed of light. It was an ultimatum : change and go forward or stay and remain backward. Many were in limbo, their roles reverse or destroyed but few immediately pivoted and found a silver lining. But do we all need to change? If so, must we change everything?
            We can make adjustments. We can change strategy. But we must never lose sight of our goals. We must maintain FOCUS. All of our goals remain, be it educational, spirtual, financial etc. They remain. What we have is an opportunity to amplify the possibility of success by making them HYBRIDS! Let us redirect our focus, strategically realign our goals and reconnect the dots. Covid-19 is spilled paint which when we step in our footprints will be etched. Welcome to the new world.</p>
